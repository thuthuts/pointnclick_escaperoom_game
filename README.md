# 🕹️ Point & Click Escape Room Game

Developed as a major project for the **"Software Development 3"** module during my third semester, this application was built by a collaborative team of five. It combines classic adventure mechanics with modern software engineering principles.

## Project Overview
In this "Point and Click" adventure, players investigate a case by collecting, examining, and using items to solve puzzles. The game features:
* **Seven unique Mini-games** to challenge the player’s logic.
* **Persistent Save System**: Save and reload game states seamlessly.
* **Character Creation Tool**: A custom-built interface for personalizing the protagonist.
* **Global Highscore List**: Competitive tracking of player performances.

## Technical Stack & Tools
* **Language/Frameworks**: `Java`, `JavaFX` (UI), `CSS` (Styling)
* **Backend & Architecture**: `Spring Framework` (Dependency Injection), `PostgreSQL`
* **Version Control**: `GitLab`, `Source Tree`
* **Documentation**: `arc42 Template`

## My Responsibilities
* **Core Implementation**: Developed the Character Creation tool, the Tutorial system, and various Mini-games.
* **Design**: Created custom pixel art graphics and animated GIFs.
* **Architecture**: Set up the **Dependency Injection** layer using the **Spring Framework** to ensure a modular and testable codebase.
* **Quality Assurance**: Wrote comprehensive **Unit Tests** for all implemented features.
* **Documentation**: Authored the technical project documentation following the professional **arc42 template**.

## Evaluation Criteria & Standards
The project was evaluated based on high industry standards, all of which were successfully met:
* **Architecture & Clean Code**: Adherence to SOLID principles and maintainable code structures.
* **Testing**: High test coverage using Unit Tests.
* **DevOps**: Efficient use of GitLab (Branching models, frequent Commits, and CI/CD).
* **Documentation**: Detailed technical breakdown via arc42.
* **MVP**: Full delivery of the Minimum Viable Product and final presentation.
